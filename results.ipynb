    "- To approximate total trials in Beron et al (2022), use 1000 simulations, but this can be manually lowered if search iterations take too long/for slower machines. \n",
    "- Best-fitting parameters are returned uing random search (the user can specify how many iterations - 50 are recommended for simpler models, 30 for more complex models)\n",
    "- The RL agent is then compared to the mouse, averaging across trial blocks, deriving the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a measure of fit, aiming to select parameters that lead to the lowest average error.\n",
    "- Given the design of the study (which involves switching arms), we need to simulate some confusion in the RL agent (to simulate mice being confused at the rewarding arm suddenly not providing a reward).\n",
    "- This is done by training the RL models on the wrong arm (with the same rewar dprobability) before learning about the new arm, to try and mimic the experience of the confused mouse.  \n",
    "- In other words, we simulate the agent having transition from a block where the reward probabilties were entirely reversed, so the agent is convinced that the wrong arm is rewarding - the same experience the mouse would have. \n",

The actual value ends up getting weighed by the experience of that event, which an optimal agent should learn = the probability condition. i.e., in the 70% reward condition, the estimated q-value at the end should end up being 0.7 (not accounting for any biases/bonuses that other models may include). \n",
